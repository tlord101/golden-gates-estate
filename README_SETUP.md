# Luxury Real Estate Website - Setup & Running Guide

## ✅ Status: Production Ready

Your website is fully functional with working email system. Everything is tested and working.

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Option 1: Run Locally (for testing)

```bash
# Install dependencies (first time only)
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

Then open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.

---

### Option 2: Production Server (recommended for deployment)

```bash
# Install dependencies (first time only)
npm install

# Build the website
npm run build

# Start production server
npm start
```

Server will run on `http://localhost:3000` (or set `PORT=3001 npm start` for different port).

---

## ✉️ Email Testing

```bash
npm run test:email
```

This runs comprehensive tests to verify email sending is working correctly.

---

## 📧 Email Configuration

Email settings are in `.env` file:

```
SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USER=onajitepeter3@gmail.com
SMTP_PASS=wflcmftzxtamfsfg
OWNER_EMAIL=Goldenstatesestates@hotmail.com
```

**⚠️ IMPORTANT:** Never share or commit `.env` file. Keep these credentials private.

## 🌐 Deployment Options

1. Sign up at https://vercel.com
2. Install Vercel CLI: `npm install -g vercel`

### Self-Hosted Server (VPS/Linode/DigitalOcean)

1. Upload all files to server
2. SSH into server
3. Install Node.js (if not installed)
4. Run:

   npm run build
   npm start

### "Failed to send email"

1. Check `.env` file has correct Gmail credentials
2. If using Gmail with 2FA, use App Password (not regular password)
3. Run `npm run test:email` to verify SMTP setup

### "Port already in use"

Run on different port:
```bash
PORT=3001 npm start
```

### Email not arriving

- Check spam/junk folder
